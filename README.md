Notebook and pdf report are in notebooks/

Settings are in config.py

To run, image folders must be present, eg:

train/ 
validation/ 
test/ 

No models are in the repository. However, pickled model outputs are stored in obj/111/ and these are sufficient for running the visualisations in the notebook.
